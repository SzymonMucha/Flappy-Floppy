# Flappy-Floppy

Simple Flappy Bird clone with a few tweaks. You play as a floppy disk, which don’t want to be read. You have to avoid contact with all the floppy readers in your way. If they push you to the left edge of the window – the game ends. Also, the disk can slide on the top (or bottom if reader is sticking out of the top edge) of a reader, gaining some speed towards right.

The game has a simple points system with highscore saved in .txt file, on the given device.
